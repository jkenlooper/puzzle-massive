# Guide on Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Puzzle Massive! I am totally open for any help with
this project. This doesn't just mean programming help, but also help with
documentation, ideas, design, etc..

There is also this helpful guide on
[How to contribute to an open source project](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

## Bug Reports

Found a bug or 'undocumented feature'? Please create an issue on this project
with as much detail as necessary in how to reproduce it if applicable. It might
just be specific to the web browser that you are using, so add the name of the
browser as well.

## New Features

I'm always open to new ideas and improvements to Puzzle Massive that would make
it more fun and entertaining to the masses. If you would like to discuss it
first casually via chat or email that is okay. You can also create a new issue
for the new feature and discuss it in the comments section there.

Before diving in to the code with your new feature idea, just give me the heads
up at least. And don't forget to ask for help if you get stuck. This
application is built on lost llamas
([chill](https://github.com/jkenlooper/chill)) and may have some things that are
not obvious.

# Goal of Puzzle Massive

The reason I built this web application was not directly for monetary reasons.
It is more of a fun side project for me and I plan to keep it that way.
I hope that someone else can learn from a project like this and be inspired to
make something that is awesome, too. Of course running a server to host Puzzle
Massive on does cost me some money, I'm fine with that and hope to have that
cost covered via sponsors and such.
