**The below instructions are still relevant if needing to troubleshoot or are
manually setting up without using the above vagrant commands. The "Initial
Setup", and "Setup For Building" sections can be skipped if using vagrant since
most of that was automatically done.**

Written for a Linux machine that is Debian based. Only tested on
[Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)](http://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/).
It is recommended to use a virtual machine of some sort to keep dependencies for
the Puzzle Massive services isolated and manageable. Some virtualization
software suggestions are listed below.

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) - can be used with Vagrant.
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) - a Vagrantfile has already been made.
- [KVM](https://wiki.debian.org/KVM) - Kernel Virtual Machine is available for
  Linux machines.

This guide assumes some familiarity with using the terminal and administrating
a Linux based machine like Ubuntu. If something isn't working right, or you get
stuck, please reach out on the
[Discord chat channels](https://discord.gg/uVhE2Kd)
for the project.

## Set local-puzzle-massive hostname

Update your `/etc/hosts` to have local-puzzle-massive map to your development
machine. This IP can either be localhost (127.0.0.1) or the IP of a virtual
machine. It is recommended that access to this development machine should be
limited so be careful if you use a development machine that is hosted in the
cloud. The local development version of the website will be at
http://local-puzzle-massive/ . If using vagrant for the virtual machine then
you'll need to use the 38682 port http://local-puzzle-massive:38682/ . There are
also some issues when using a port like 38682 on the local-puzzle-massive host
and the website does a redirect.

Append "127.0.0.1 local-puzzle-massive" to your `/etc/hosts` file on the local
machine (not the development machine). You'll then be able to access your local
version of the site at the http://local-puzzle-massive/ URL. If installed on
a virtual machine; then change the 127.0.0.1 to that IP of the virtual machine.
This IP can be found by logging into the virtual machine and using this command:
`ip -4 -br addr show`

```bash
# Update 127.0.0.1 to be the IP of the development machine
echo "127.0.0.1 local-puzzle-massive" >> /etc/hosts
```

## Initial Setup

After cloning or forking the git repo
[puzzle-massive](https://github.com/jkenlooper/puzzle-massive); open a terminal
and `cd` to that directory.

The instructions shown here assume that you are logged into a Linux system
(`uname -o`) and are running Ubuntu (`lsb_release -a`).

### Create `dev` user and project source directory

Use `ssh` to login into the development machine either as root (`ssh root@local-puzzle-massive`) or as a user that has `sudo` permissions.

```bash
ssh local-puzzle-massive;
```

Create the `dev` user for Puzzle Massive. This user will own the sqlite database
among other things. There are other commands that set up ssh and adds your
public key to your virtual machine. See the bin/init.sh for that if you are
using a separate machine (virtual machine) as your development machine.

While logged into the development machine.

```bash
# Run only some commands from bin/init.sh to create the 'dev' user:
sudo adduser dev;
# Set the user to have sudo privileges by placing in the sudo group
sudo usermod -aG sudo dev;
```

Create the initial source directory that files will by `rsync`ed to on the
development machine.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/src/puzzle-massive;
sudo chown dev:dev /usr/local/src/puzzle-massive;
```

Logout (exit) from the development machine. Most of the time this will be
implied in the different sections of this guide.

```bash
# Get back to your local machine by exiting the development machine.
exit;
```

### Add initial files to `/usr/local/src/puzzle-massive`

Development can be done with any text editor or IDE that you are comfortable
with. To better match a production environment the project's source files are
copied over to the /usr/local/src/puzzle-massive/ directory on the development machine.

The `bin/devsync.sh` script is a wrapper around `rsync` that will upload the
source files to the development machine. The destination path is by default
the `/usr/local/src/puzzle-massive/` directory that was created when the dev
user was made.

```bash
# On the local machine
./bin/devsync.sh;
```

### Install dependencies

Should be logged into the development machine

```bash
ssh dev@local-puzzle-massive;
```

Run the initial setup script that will install many of the dependencies with
apt-get the Debian based package manager. The redis config is also updated to
set maxmemory when running the setup.sh script.

```bash
cd /usr/local/src/puzzle-massive/;

# Install other software dependencies with apt-get and npm.
sudo ./bin/setup.sh;
```

### Create local SSL certs (optional)

Should be logged into the development machine

```bash
ssh dev@local-puzzle-massive;
```

To have TLS (SSL) on your development machine run the
`provision-local-ssl-certs.sh` script. That will use `openssl` to create some
certs in the web/ directory. The `localhost-CA.pem` file that is created in the
home directory by default should be imported to Keychain Access and marked as
always trusted. The Firefox web browser will require importing the
`localhost-CA.pem` certificate authority file.

```bash
./bin/provision-local-ssl-certs.sh
```

### Create the `.env` file

Use this script to create the `.env` file. The `.env` file should
**not** be added to the distribution or to source control (git). Edit it as
needed for your use case. It should stay within the project's directory.

Run this on the _local machine_ from within the project's directory (use `exit`
command if still logged into development machine).

```bash
# Create or update the .env file
./bin/create_dot_env.sh;
```

## Setup For Building

The website apps are managed as
[systemd](https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) services.
The service config files are created by running `make` and installed with
`sudo make install`. It is recommended to use Python's `python -m venv .`
and activating each time for a new shell with `source bin/activate` before
running `make`.

### Initialize the project

```bash
# Setup to use a virtual python environment
python -m venv .
source bin/activate;

# Install black to format python code when developing
python -m pip install black;

# Build the dist files for local development
nvm use;
npm install;

# Checkout any git submodules in this repo if didn't
# `git clone --recurse-submodules ...`.
git submodule init;
git submodule update;

# If using site-specific-content then create symbolic links to that content from
# that git submodule. A Makefile should be in the site-specific-content
directory.
(if [ -d site-specific-content ]; then
  cd site-specific-content
  make
  make install
fi)

# Build the dist files for local development
npm run build;

# Upload the changes to the development machine
./bin/devsync.sh
```

The limits for ImageMagick may need to be updated. Copy the
`/etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml` file from your development machine and replace
the one included with the project. Check the differences and either edit it or
use what the project has set. _This step is optional_, but the policy file will
still be updated when running the `make install` command. When the
`make uninstall` is used it is restored to how it was before.

```bash
# Grab the policy from your development machine.
scp dev@local-puzzle-massive:/etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml resources/imagemagick-policy.xml;

# Show the differences.
git diff resources/imagemagick-policy.xml;

# Use what was set for the project if it looked okay.
git checkout resources/imagemagick-policy.xml;
```

### Initialize the development machine

Should be logged into the development machine.

```bash
ssh dev@local-puzzle-massive;
```

```bash
cd /usr/local/src/puzzle-massive/;

# Setup to use a virtual python environment
python -m venv .
source bin/activate;

# Makes the initial development version
make;

# Install the files that were compiled.
sudo make install;

# Stop the apps here since we need to update the database.
sudo ./bin/appctl.sh stop -f;

# Create the puzzle database tables and initial data
python api/api/create_database.py site.cfg;

# Update any bit icon authors and add new bit icons if applicable
python api/api/jobs/insert-or-replace-bit-icons.py

# Update the enabled puzzle features if applicable
python api/api/update_enabled_puzzle_features.py

# Test and reload the nginx configurations
sudo nginx -t;
sudo systemctl reload nginx;

# Start the apps and monitor the logs
sudo ./bin/appctl.sh start;
sudo ./bin/log.sh;
```

## Developing Puzzle Massive locally and creating puzzles

After the initial install of Puzzle Massive on your machine there won't be any
puzzles yet. You'll need to create one (create two to avoid a bug when only one
is available) by visiting the super secret URL for directly creating new
puzzles:
http://local-puzzle-massive/chill/site/new-puzzle/[NEW_PUZZLE_CONTRIB]/

After creating some new puzzles, the next step is to moderate them and start
the rendering process. That can be accomplished by logging into the admin side:
http://local-puzzle-massive/chill/site/admin/puzzle/ . This admin UI is super
clunky and has a lot of room for improvement. You'll need to batch edit the
submitted puzzles to be approved and then click on render.

### Creating random puzzles and players for testing

A script to generate a variety of puzzles and player data is used when
developing to better simulate conditions on a production version. Run this
script as needed. Some examples to get started are shown here.

Should be logged into the development machine.

```bash
ssh dev@local-puzzle-massive;
```

```bash
cd /usr/local/src/puzzle-massive/;
source bin/activate;

puzzle-massive-testdata players --count=100;

puzzle-massive-testdata puzzles --count=30 --min-pieces=9 --pieces=200 --size=180x180\!;
puzzle-massive-testdata puzzles --count=10 --min-pieces=20 --pieces=900 --size=800x1500\!;
puzzle-massive-testdata puzzles --count=10 --min-pieces=20 --pieces=900 --size=1800x1300\!;
puzzle-massive-testdata instances --count=10 --min-pieces=20 --pieces=500;
puzzle-massive-testdata puzzles --count=1 --pieces=2000 --size=3800x3500\!;
```

### Building the `dist/` files

The javascript and CSS files in the `dist/` directory are built from the source
files in `src/` by running the `npm run build` command from your local machine. This uses
[rollup](http://rollupjs.org/) and is configured with the
`rollup.config.js`. The entry file is `src/index.js` and following that the
main app bundle (`app.bundle.js`, `app.bundle.css`) is built from
`src/app.js`.

The source files for javascript and CSS are organized mostly as components. The
`src/site/` being an exception as it includes CSS and javascript used across the
whole site. Each component includes its own CSS (if applicable) and the CSS
classes follow the
[SUIT CSS naming conventions](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md).

When editing files in `src/` either run `npm run debug` or `npm run watch`. The
production version is done with `npm run build` which will create compressed
versions of the files. To upload the just compiled files in the `dist/`
directory use the `bin/devsync.sh` command.

```bash
# Build the dist files and rsync them to the development machine
npm run debug && ./bin/devsync.sh;

# Or watch for changes in src/, build, and rsync to development machine
./bin/distwatch.js &
npm run watch;
pkill --full -u $(whoami) "\./bin/distwatch\.js";
```

## Regenerating with cookiecutter

Get the latest changes from the cookiecutter that initially generated the
project
([jkenlooper/cookiecutter-website](https://github.com/jkenlooper/cookiecutter-website))
by uninstalling the app, running the cookiecutter in a different directory, and
then rsync the changed files back in. Use `git` to then patch files as needed.

```bash
now=$(date --iso-8601 --utc)
# In the project directory of puzzle-massive.
cd ../;
mkdir puzzle-massive--${now};
cd puzzle-massive--${now};

# Regenerate using last entered config from initial project.  Then git clean the
# new project files that were just created.
cookiecutter \
  --config-file ../puzzle-massive/.cookiecutter-regen-config.yaml \
  gh:jkenlooper/cookiecutter-website renow=${now};
cd puzzle-massive;
git clean -fdx;

# Back to parent directory
cd ../../;

# Create backup tar of project directory before removing all untracked files.
tar --auto-compress --create --file puzzle-massive-${now}.bak.tar.gz puzzle-massive;
cd puzzle-massive;
git clean -fdx --exclude=.env;
cd ../;

# Use rsync to copy over the generated project
# (puzzle-massive--${now}/puzzle-massive)
# files to the initial project.
# This will delete all files from the initial project.
rsync -a \
  --itemize-changes \
  --delete \
  --exclude=.git/ \
  --exclude=.env \
  puzzle-massive--${now}/puzzle-massive/ \
  puzzle-massive

# Remove the generated project after it has been rsynced.
rm -rf puzzle-massive--${now};

# Patch files (git add) and drop changes (git checkout) as needed.
# Refer to the backup puzzle-massive-${now}.bak.tar.gz
# if a file or directory that was not tracked by git is missing.
cd puzzle-massive;
git add -i .;
git checkout -p .;
```
